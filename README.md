# 6502-compiler
A very basic compiler targeting the 65C02 instruction set

I'm thinking this project will be implemented in Rust. I have been trying to learn rust, but I need a project to learn it properly. I'm also using Rust because I came across a resource stating that Go and Rust are good languages to implement a compiler in. I don't understand why yet, since as far as I know most languages are implemented in C/C++, but surely I'll find out once I get into it.

I will keep a folder of resources in this repository, and references to them in this document as I learn more about what I'm doing.

Surely regex will be involved in a compiler, so here's a link to [using regex in Rust](https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.4/regex/)
